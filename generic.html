							<p>Hi , my name is Shahzaib Chawhan I am a American born Pakistani , and I love to program. My favourite pastime's include watching cricket , playing american football , and eating food. my main goal as a programmer is to become a white hat hacker and try to reverse engineer malicous software. My favourite programming language is python as it is very easy and simple to learn and can be applied to different programs. </p>
							<p>In my python career I have created many different programs. Some of the main ones that I have made or have been involved in are included in my website as you could see prevously.One of my main traits as a programmer is that I am very ambitous and I think that is a very useful trait in programming as it will help you learn more programs , and languages. My end goal language's to learn are Java , Css , and C# as they are very useful.</p>
